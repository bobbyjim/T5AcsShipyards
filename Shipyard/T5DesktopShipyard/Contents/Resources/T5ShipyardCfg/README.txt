T5 Desktop Shipyard Configuration Files (2016)
Notes written 2023.

These are config files used by my shipyard design program.  They're in YAML, which these days is easily convertible to JSON or any other format.  

Anyway, I strove to move a lot of data outside of the program itself, because I knew:

* some values would be likely to change, 
* I would want to add some helpful new items, 
* I would want to test new things out.

So I did what I could without inordinate effort, and it was COMPLETELY WORTH IT.

I strongly urge you, if you design a shipyard designer, to make it trivially easy to tweak data without forcing a rebuild of the program, however that can be done.  For programs like this, that meant config files.  

I think the formats will be self-explanatory.  If you can track me down, I can explain any strange parts.  I have tried to keep in line with official Traveller5 data.
